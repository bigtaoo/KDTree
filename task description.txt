Gritworld GmbH Coding Test

Problem:
You get a set of 2D points in a file named point_set_small.txt and point_set_big.txt. It is guaranteed that each point is unique
and that only one solution exists. We provide a small framework to read 
in the content of the files. Your task is to find for each point the closest neighboring point. 
You can compare your results with our solution in the solution_small.txt and solution_big.txt.
The pair is structured like: <point, closest neighbor of the point>. 
We favour a solution you are proud of more than a quick and dirty one, so take your time.
The point_set_small.txt is for testing and contains only 10 points. point_set_big.txt contains 100000 points.
The points are scattered in the range between ([0, 1000000], [0, 1000000]).
Feel free to add your own classes. Add a small text which describes your solution.


Conditions:
- programming language is C++
- no third party library beside of STL

We care about:
- code style: The code should be readable.
- performance: The solution should be faster than brute force, making use of a multi core processor is a bonus.
- elegancy: The solution should be simple.
